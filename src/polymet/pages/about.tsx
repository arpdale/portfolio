              <p className="text-xl">
                I'm a strategic design leader with a passion for creating
                human-centered systems that solve complex problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey began with a Mechanical Engineering degree from
                Stanford, where I discovered my love for the intersection of
                technology and human needs. This led me to the world of design,
                where I've spent the last 15+ years building products and teams
                across healthcare, fintech, and emerging technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2005, I founded Design For Use, a design agency that grew to
                28 people across the US and South America. We partnered with
                organizations ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies,
                helping them create digital products that delivered real
                business impact while meeting user needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                After selling the agency, I moved into in-house leadership roles
                where I could focus on building long-term product visions and
                scaling design teams. I'm particularly passionate about
                mentoring designers and helping them grow their careers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I'm focused on how AI can enhance human capabilities
                rather than replace them. I believe we're at an inflection point
                in design, where our role is evolving from crafting interfaces
                to designing intelligent systems that collaborate with users.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not designing, I teach design leadership at UT Austin,
                sharing my experience with the next generation of designers. I
                also enjoy woodworking, playing ukulele, hiking, and tinkering
                with vintage cars.

              <p>
                My approach to design has been shaped by a diverse set of
                influences:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>BJ Fogg's Behavior Model</strong> - Understanding the
                  triggers, motivation, and ability factors that drive human
                  behavior
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Simon Sinek's "Start With Why"</strong> - Focusing on
                  purpose before implementation
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Daniel Pink's work on motivation</strong> - Designing
                  for autonomy, mastery, and purpose
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Nir Eyal's "Hooked" model</strong> - Creating
                  habit-forming products (used ethically!)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I believe that great design happens at the intersection of human
                needs, business goals, and technological capabilities. My
                philosophy centers on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Human-centered + Systems-oriented</strong> - Deeply
                  caring about users while connecting the dots across data,
                  technology, and business
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Building for impact</strong> - Creating solutions that
                  deliver measurable results, not just pretty interfaces
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Collaborative leadership</strong> - Bringing out the
                  best in teams through mentorship and shared vision
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Continuous learning</strong> - Staying curious and
                  adapting to emerging technologies and methods
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
